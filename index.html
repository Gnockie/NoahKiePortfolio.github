    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm Noah Kienesberger, a 16-year-old student at HTL Spengergasse, where I'm learning about the world of
      Game Design. Ever since I can remember, I've been captivated by the power of digital art and the limitless
      possibilities of creating games.</p>
    <h3>My Journey</h3>
    From a young age, I was fascinated by video games and the artistry behind them. Starting with the timeless game
    Minecraft, this
    passion led me to HTL Spengergasse, a school known for its focus on technical and creative education. Here, I am
    honing my skills in the game design branch, where I learn about programming, 3D modeling, art and well ...
    gamedesign.

    <br><br>
    <h3>What I love</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Game Design: Creating engaging and innovative games to entertain players.</li> <br>
      <li>Digital Art: Bringing ideas to life through digital painting, 3D modeling, and animation.</li> <br>
      <li>Storytelling: Crafting compelling narratives that make games more than just a series of levels but an
        experience, like in the games you can see in <a href="games.html">my games tab</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Software: Unity2D, Maya3D, Photoshop, Illustrator, Aseprite, Reaper, MS Office</li> <br>
      <li>Abilities: Gamedesign, Leveldesign, Digital Art, 3D Modeling, Programming (C#), Sounddesign, Project
        managment, Animation</li> <br>
      <li>More info in my <a href="Lebenslauf_Kienesberger.pdf">resum√©</a></li>

    <h3>My vision</h3>
    <p>
      I believe in the transformative power of games. They can entertain, educate, and even change perspectives. My goal
      is to contribute to this dynamic industry by creating games that are not only fun to play but also leave a lasting
      impact on the players.

      When I'm not designing games or creating digital art, you can find me exploring the latest in technology, playing
      the newest games, or getting inspired by nature and everyday life.

      Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I'm excited to share my journey and projects with you!
