    <h4>HealingHurdles: Navigate through the five stages of grief in HealingHurdles, where every obstacle is a step towards
    acceptance</h4>
    This game was a project for school, all the art was made by me, 
    but the focus of the game was on the leveldesign. I tried to really make players feel through the five stages of grief, 
    which is what the game is themed after.

    <h4>DuckyDisaster: An XRay adventure </h4>
    This game was for a school exercise about Sprite masks. Both the graphics and the code was made in about two days. 
    In DuckyDisaster you have to safe your patient, by removing foreign objects from their body and making sure all their organs are in place.
